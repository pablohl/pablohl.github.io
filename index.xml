      <description>In my previous post I discussed how to be a great intern, now I&amp;rsquo;ll try to provide a complementary view on how I think a great supervisor should do.
 Trade-offs One of the most difficult parts of being a good supervisor is deciding what role you need to play during the internship to maximize both the intern&amp;rsquo;s interests and yours. For example, as a supervisor you can &amp;ldquo;force&amp;rdquo; the intern to work on your project/ideas, but if the intern is not interested it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a huge loss of time and effort (for both).</description>

      <description>About Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Pablo, I&amp;rsquo;m currently a machine learning researcher at Borealis AI which is part of RBC (Royal Bank of Canada) in Toronto, Canada. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on fundamental research in multiagent deep reinforcement learning (for example in this NeurIPS Pommerman competition), auxiliary tasks for Deep RL and robustness in RL. During this time I had the pleasure to work with Matthew E. Taylor (now at U of Alberta). In terms of applied research I have worked on explainability for an RL agent that is trading in markets.</description>
